Project Overview
This system is split into two parts:

The Server (ESP32-CAM - The "Eye" 👁️):

It takes pictures of the projected surface.

It processes the image to find the brightest pixel, which is the laser dot.

It creates a WiFi Access Point and hosts a tiny web server.

When another device requests the /coords URL, it sends back the laser's current (x, y) coordinates.

The Client (ESP32 Board - The "Brain" 🧠):

It connects to the WiFi Access Point created by the ESP32-CAM.

It repeatedly requests the coordinates from the CAM's web server.

It receives the coordinates and can use them to trigger actions (e.g., turn on an LED, send a command, etc.). For this example, we will simply print them to the Serial Monitor.
